# Contributing

We welcome contributions to this list of high-quality Move content--just send a pull request!

As the list grows over time, we may do more curation by splitting some sections from the list into separate docs and highlight a smaller set of prominent projects on the front page.

However, we will always bias toward inclusion of anything a Move community member might find interesting or useful.

## PR Requirements and Guidelines
Ensure your addition and the pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- **Use the following format**: `[project](link) - Description.`
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- If you submit a project that is similar to an existing project in the list, describe how it's different.
- Link to the GitHub repo, if applicable.
- The pull request should have a useful title and include a link to the package and why it should be included.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Descriptions should
  - be short and simple, but descriptive,
  - not be marketing taglines,
  - not be title-case,
  - begin with a capital,
  - end with a full stop/period,
  - not have trailing whitespaces.
- Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome, but should be done in a separate pull request. **Remember to update the [`Contents`](README.md#contents) accordingly!**
- Check your spelling and grammar.

Thank you for your suggestion!

## Updating Your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult. If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it. If you're not sure how to do that, [here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
